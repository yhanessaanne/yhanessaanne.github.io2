## Overview
The problem: Due to the ongoing pandemic there is the issue of college students not being able to socialize amongst their fellow peers. This lack of social interaction will cause students to know less of their peers and through some extension, have less networking options. In order to have a productive university education, socializing and networking with peers can not be neglected.

The solution: As a way to solve this issue, we present the idea of Cluster Flock to allow students of the UH Manoa community to socialize again under the pandemic. Whether it be under business or networking motivations or to just expand the friend group, this project will help students break the ice and interact with one another again as we readjust to normal life post-pandemic. This can also be used post-pandemic as well.

## Mockup page ideas

- Possible mockup pages could be:
- Landing page
- User home page
- Admin page
- Browse people/groups by interests, classes, and majors. 
- A forums page
- Direct messaging 
- Bookmark posts

## Use case ideas

- New user goes to landing page, sets up new profile, goes to home page, browses groups
- User goes to home page, browses groups by interest, checks forums, sends messages
- Admin goes to home page, monitors postings, updates group info

## Beyond the Basics
- If applicable, upload club data from the CSV version of the RIO spreadsheet to associate with their group.
- Notify admins of new groups being made.
- Define groups as active or inactive depending on their recent activity.
