## Overview
The problem: Due to the ongoing pandemic there is the issue of college students not being able to socialize amongst their fellow peers. This lack of social interaction will cause students to know less of their peers and through some extension, have less networking options.

The solution: As a way to solve this issue, we present the idea of [insert project name here] to allow students of the UH Manoa community to socialize again under the pandemic. Whether it be under business or networking motivations or to just expand the friend group, this project will help students break the ice and interact with one another again as we readjust to normal life post-pandemic. This can also be used post-pandemic as well.
