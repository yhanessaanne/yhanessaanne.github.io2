I consider myself a beginner when it comes to programming as I still make a lot of small careless mistakes. When I look back at my old assignments and projects from my intro to Java class, I cringe for letting myself comment on almost every line of code, have incorrect indentations, brackets at the start of each line, unnecessary line spaces, and many more that violate basic coding standards. I remember the frustration of trying to figure out where the missing bracket was supposed to be placed. Overtime, I was introduced to code analysis tools to help me fix my disorganization.

The installment of the IntelliJ Idea IDE and configuring its setting and plug-ins was a tedious process. Setting up ESLint didn’t bother me either because of my familiarity of using checkstyle in Eclipse, so coding standards weren't new to me. The procedure was fine,  until I learned that I have to load the “.eslintrc” every *single* time I create a new project. Although it is a simple addition to the creation of a project, I found myself having to be extra attentive to which folder I load the files in, considering the fact that I have the habit of not paying attention to what folders I put my downloads in most of the time.

	My first impression of using IntelliJ and ESLint after a week, is that it is very user friendly and helpful. So far, it’s been forcing me to fix my code along the way, rather than fixing everything at the very end. Personally for me, it’s a bit annoying to see angry red lines and warning signs from ESLint, so I have the obsession of needing to get rid of them right away. The feedback is very helpful and helps me to reduce any further errors later on. Obtaining the green check mark, along with the nice view of my readable code, is a satisfying feeling.

	Coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language because it encourages you to learn more about it when you’re first introduced to code with clean, proper structure. It provides the learner with familiarity of the syntax, rules, and the capabilities of the actual programming language. It is understandable that everyone may have their own ways of formatting their code, but there will come a day where it is necessary to share it. So, it would just be better to learn some coding conventions to establish an efficient environment. 

 Overall, coding standards should be one of the techniques a software engineer should have on the top of their list to improve quality. When it comes to coding style, the ease of comprehending code is beneficial for everyone. Looking at code with inconsistent style is unappealing, especially when collaborating with other programmers. The time it takes to look at code and grasp the basic idea of what is going on can be greatly reduced if it follows some coding principles. The implementation of coding standards in one’s programming career should be supported not only because of its effectiveness, but also to appreciate the utilization of the advanced tools that are available for us.
