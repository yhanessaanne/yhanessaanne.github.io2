## A Side By Side Perspective

In high school I took AP Art History where I learned a couple main principles of design: balance, rhythm, pattern, emphasis, contrast, unity, movement, repetition. Although these principles of design do not necessarily solve particular problems in art, they are more like tools and foundations for visual artists to use as a template to further enhance the meaning and composition of their pieces in their own style. These principles are used in every art analysis to understand why a piece of artwork evokes certain emotions from people. It is important to understand why certain techniques work so that they can be replicated in different ways and be used as inspiration for many artists. 

In my software engineering class, we are being introduced to design patterns. As described by Christopher Alexander, design patterns “describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.”  In a general sense, design patterns are essentially set templates in order to produce reusable solutions to solve common problems in software. Examples of design patterns are but limited to factory, singleton, observer, and model-view-controller (MVC). Although I’m still fairly new to the concept, I think it is crucial to understand these terms in order to truly appreciate its reusability in code.

## Using Patterns

I’m sure that everyone has analyzed some piece of artwork on the basic level without knowing it. For example, color plays a big role in creating a piece. We associate the color red with either anger or love. This is because the color red radiates such intensity which is why it is associated with strong and bold emotions such as anger or love. Thus, red is used to represent such things in many artworks in order to successfully display these emotions. 

Likewise, I did not realize that I’ve been utilizing a few design patterns in my current web application project. In my current project, my group and I have been exposed to prototype, model-view-controller, and observer, which happens to be design patterns that are already specific to Javascript and Meteor. Outside of those two, our project also implements the use of singleton and factory design patterns.


## Conclusion

I had to study and analyze 250 artworks for my AP Art History class. Throughout the stress and sleepless nights, I successfully passed the AP exam. As a result, I earned college credit to help lessen the amount of classes I have to take in college. I feel like I could go on and on with my favorite pieces of art because the principles of design are ingrained into my mind. Thankfully there are only 23 design patterns, but I hope to possibly gain a better understanding of some of them. So, when they come up as an interview question, my knowledge of design patterns will help me earn a job or internship in the future.
