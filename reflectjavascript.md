## Conflicting Favorites

It is very easy to convince me which programming language is the best. My first language I learned was Java and was told all about the great and powerful things Java can do. Then I took a course taught in C and C++ where the Professor liked to throw Java itself into its own garbage collection. So, I hopped into the bandwagon and was convinced that C and C++ were my favorite languages despite the all nighters I had to pull for that class. After watching Dr.Johnson's <a href="https://youtu.be/H0qNUqoJqkQ">video</a> on Javascript, I was of course easily persuaded into the opinion that Javascript is better than Java and C++.  

Learning Javascript has been a smooth journey so far. I find it interesting how many shortcuts you can do for the sake of shortening code. My first impression of Javascript was that it was easy to understand, until I got to the ES6 exercises. It was unusual reaching for the backtick character on my keyboard as it was probably the one the least used keys for me. As I delved more into the exercises, I learned the many benefits of ES6.

From a software engineering perspective, I think Javascript is a good programming language. The flexibility and simplicity of the language provides a reason for programmers to learn it. Although my experience in Javascript is quite narrow, I believe that Javascript will be beneficial to software engineers at some point of their career.

## Athletic Software Engineering

When I was in high school, there was a thing called “mile Mondays” for my physical education class and I absolutely hated it at the beginning. My time for the first mile was around 14 minutes while the expected time was 6-7 minutes. Overtime, as I ran the mile more, I got faster and improved my time to run a mile between the recommended time. From there, I looked forward to every Monday during that school year. And now I enjoy taking a run from time to time. 

I think the same experience of “mile Mondays” can be applied to my training in athletic software engineering. My first practice WOD reminded me how unfit my mind is in a sense that I was slow at thinking of a solution. I blame myself for not timing myself and giving up right afterwards when I do challenges on <a href="https://edabit.com/">Edabit.</a> The time limit adds quite a bit of pressure but I like the idea of it having it. As of right now, I find the WODs to be stressful because of a time limit, but I will eventually enjoy it if I keep on practicing and making progress. Hopefully athletic software engineering will get me in shape and put my skills into good use.
