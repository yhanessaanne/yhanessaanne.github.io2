I created a simple to-do list extension for Google Chrome. I decided to go with creating a chrome extension because there are many sources and tutorials to get started. The idea of a to-do list came to mind when I found myself losing the piece of paper of where I write my tasks down for the day. Although there are many to-do list extensions in the Chrome Web Store, I wanted to learn new things, such as Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also took this oppurtunity as the chance to prepare for ICS 314 as the class teaches Javascript.

During this process, I learned how all three of these scripting langauges work together. Working around a json file was something I didn't know about before this project. Educating myself with these three things at the same time was overwhelming at first but I learned the basics one step at a time. I believe that all three of these langauges are needed in order to successfully complete this project. 

This extension allows the user to click on the extension icon to add, delete, and check off completed tasks. To further improve this project, I hope to have more of an appealing user-interface and design by devloping my skills in CSS. I also hope to add more features like sorting tasks in order of priority as well as the option to create a to-do list for the upcoming days. 

Source code to be made available soon.
